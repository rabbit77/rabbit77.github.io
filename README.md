# EverCoding.net

A static blog built with [Jekyll][] on github pages

**EverCoding.net** is my domain.

Anyone can fork this repository, and please change the information in `_config.yml`. Don't forget change the Google Analysis and Baidu Tongji code. All my articles need to be removed.

With this blog, I will write something about programming, programmers and some of my life  
I hope I would not give up updating this blog

**Always not be fickle in a fickle day!**  
**Having Dream, Heart Live**
